# React + Vite

React boiler plate for pagination feature
In this templaet I have tried implementing clean and maintainable architecture with modular approach. The schema includes mainly three steps UI layer --> Logic layer --> Data layer :

Presentation Layer → UI Components (Render UI, handle interactions, dispatch redux actions)
Application Layer → Redux + Business Flow (Manage Redux state, Async API calls)
Domain Layer → Pure Business Logic ( Paginations calculations, Logic and rules)
Data Layer → API Repository ( API calls, response normalization to json, network error abstrcation)
